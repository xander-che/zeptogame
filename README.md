Discrete time series forecasting research

## About the progect
The main idea of the project is to explore the possibility of forecasting discrete time series. The research is carried out on the example of predicting the results of football matches from various championships. At the first stage, an attempt was made to predict the total number of goals scored by both teams (TOTAL). The results of the daily forecasting are presented on the [progect-site](https://zeptogame.com), as well as in the [telegram-channel](https://t.me/zeptogame).
